[Fantastic plugin and superb support](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fantastic-plugin-and-superb-support-4/)
This is an excellent plugin to create professional and attractive team page, with intuitive styling and layout options. But what really makes the difference to me as a designer is the first class support from RadiusTheme. I use this plugin and Post Grid. When I have had any queries, the team replies quickly and really goes the extra mile to provide a solution to any needs. Much appreciated!
